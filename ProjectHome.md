Still under heavy development Consider it an alpha!
Currently it supports executing files and a full WMI implmentation
Also has a few helper commands, configuration is in XML.

(For an easy way to check out the available WMI classes use [WMI Code Creator (Microsoft.com)](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=2cc30a64-ea15-4661-8da4-55bbc145c30e&displaylang=en) The available classes are under the namespace root\CIMV2 and begin with Win32_(Do not use the Win32_ beginning in your xml)

**Wonky now has support for everest, allowing you to read temperatures, voltages, power, fan speeds!**

For an example configuration file check [here](ExampleXML.md) and for an introduction check [here](Introduction.md)
