= Introduction =

Wonky is a windows .NET executable capable of showing your system statistics(and whatever else you may like) on your desktop, It's somewhat similar to Conky (for linux).

Still under a lot of construction, but so far it implements the following:
  * WMI
  * Executing programs/Scripts
  * Using custom images
  * Full XML configuration
  * Helper utilities for converting between bytes/kilobytes etc
  * Helper utilities for trimming and manipulating text
  * Data caching for speed

There's still _a lot_ more to be done, and if you can submit as many bugs/feature requests as possible!

For an example configuration file check out [XMLExample]


== Notes ==

Commands in the line="" blocks in the configuration are surrounded by {'s for example to get the cpu name using WMI the following code would work
{{{
	<Block x="50" y="43" FontSize="8" line="{WMI.Processor.Name}" />
}}}
Quite a few WMI responses return multiple lines thats when : comes into play
for example if your computer has multiple network adapters (it will) then WMI
returns an instance for each 
adapter. So if my card was number 13 (NetworkAdapters.exe included in the zip will tell you your card number) then i would use the following code:
{{{
	<Block x="50" y="123" FontSize="8" line="{WMI.NetworkAdapter.Name:13}" />
}}}
Further more some responses include multiple instances with multiple lines following the same suite this code would work to get your IPV4/IPV6 address for your selected adapter
{{{
	<Block x="50" y="143" FontSize="8" line="ipv4: {WMI.NetworkAdapterConfiguration.IPAddress:13} | ipv6: {WMI.NetworkAdapterConfiguration.IPAddress:13:1}" />
}}}

The above examples stay true from program execution, another example is if i wanted to get my externalip from a vbscript (ExternalIP.vbs is included in the zip) i would use the following code:
{{{
        <Block x="50" y="125" FontSize="8" line="External IP: {EXEC.'cscript.exe ExternalIP.vbs //Nologo'}" />
}}}

That covers the major 2 components, now for a couple of small ones
to include a picture into your configuration you could do this:
{{{
	<Block x="0" y="0" w="24" h="24" line="{IMAGE.'Win.png'}" />
}}}
